# What Makes Games Successful
"If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?" - Anton Chigurh

When I meet strangers and ask about their game projects, more often than not they say something like, "We're working on a Turn-Based Rhythm Farming Sim", or a "Couch Co-op Souls-like Cooking RTS". My gut instinct is to be dismissive. However, I bite my tongue, because I have seen too many successes that simply boggle the mind; perhaps they know something that I do not.

Take for example the game Megabonk, which is a "Rogue-like Horde-survival Auto-shooter". Why did this game take off so spectacularly? Megabonk's gameplay loops are complimentary. But many games have complimentary gameplay loops. Its genres feel synergistic rather than stitched together. Again, many games share these traits. Maybe it's just the vibes? But this is an intellectual cop-out. After all, how does one measure vibes?

I am extremely skeptical of these analyses, which are extremely over-determined. Take for example the game Among Us. It was an absolute flop on release, and only became successful a few years after launch when governments forced citizens into home isolation in response to Covid-19. The game became a spectacular way to connect with friends due to the easy learning curve and fun team gameplay.

Much like Chigurh's coin flips in No Country for Old Men, we tell ourselves stories to make randomness seem predestined. The same applies to games. Analyses of successes often ascribe design genius or market foresight where there was mostly circumstance. The timing, platform visibility, and streamer virility are Chigurh's coins flipping in the air. Developers, critics, and players alike pretend to understand why a game "worked", but more often they’re just narrating coincidence as destiny.

One must take extreme caution not to infer the wrong lesson. To ascribe these successes to pure luck is equally foolish. If randomness underlies success, perhaps the key is not to deny luck, but to understand its varieties.
| **Type of Luck** | **Description** | **Example Games** |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Blind Luck** | Success that happens by chance — external timing, viral spread, or unexpected cultural relevance. The creators didn’t plan or control it; fortune just struck. | *Among Us* becomes a global hit during lockdowns; *Flappy Bird* goes viral through memes; *Fall Guys* releases at the perfect moment for cheerful multiplayer chaos. |
| **Luck from Motion (Active Effort & Hustle)** | Luck generated through sheer activity - constant experimentation, shipping, iterating, and adapting. The more actions you take, the more chances luck has to find you. | *Fortnite* pivots from a failing co-op shooter to battle royale overnight; *No Man’s Sky* rebuilds its reputation through years of updates; Supercell’s iterative "cell" model produces hits like *Clash of Clans*. |
| **Luck from Awareness (Recognizing Opportunities)** | Luck that comes from sharp perception - spotting shifts, unmet needs, or emerging patterns before others do. Success arises from being attuned to where things are moving. | *Grow a Garden* identifies that Gen Z never had a Farmville experience; Valve notices the mod community's potential, turning *Counter-Strike* into a full franchise. |
| **Luck from Uniqueness (Attracting Luck)** | Luck that *comes to you* because your work or identity is distinctive - others seek you out to collaborate, adapt your IP, or leverage your creative voice. | *FromSoftware*’s style attracts global partnerships (*Elden Ring* with George R. R. Martin); *Kojima Productions* gets offers from major studios post-*Death Stranding*. |

These categories shape how developers approach risk and decision-making. Many studios, operate somewhere between the `Blind Luck` and `Luck From Motion` categories. These are often mistaken for opposites: one passive, one active, only differing in the number of attempts at success. Fortnite's victory over PUBG is often told as a story of perfect execution, overtaking a good game with a better one. But this erases the randomness beneath. Fortnite was Epic's third swing after Unreal Tournament and Paragon failed. Motion didn’t remove luck; it only gave 'fate' more chances to show itself. Chigurh's coin does not reveal destiny, it only reveals chance.

The `Luck from Uniqueness` category is Chigurhian in a different sense. A precondition of this type of luck is that you are already somewhat successful in a domain. Take for example Lena Raine, who composed with a unique emotional synth style in the game Celeste. This caught Mojang's attention, leading to a contract for Minecraft: Caves & Cliffs. On a larger scale, there are examples like Avalanche Software, a 150 person development team acquired by Warner Brothers from Disney. This team already had experience with family-friendly licensed worlds, making them absolutely perfect to develop Hogwarts Legacy. In both cases, previous successes and unique skills compound into future successes. Instead of finding the luck, the luck finds you.

For those who are high agency, `Luck from Awareness` offers the most hope of success. From your unique understanding of the world, you can potentially see where the ball is going before it gets there. While it would be foolish of me to give you ideas for what this might look like, because the entire premise is to be ahead of the curve.

However, I can give you some examples drawing from my own personal experiences. I believed that educational games at a AA or AAA quality would be the future. I drew from my own experiences learning French, and we set out on a language learning game in Unreal Engine. Despite drawing from my "awareness", the project was a complete failure.

This is where even more caution is required. Borrowing from the opening line of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way". There is often only one way to succeed, to make something people want. However, there are infinite ways to fail. Did my game fail because of the art style? Maybe we needed to start with a cool language, like Japanese? Perhaps we should have used a different game engine. Did we market hard enough? Maybe our team just wasn't a good fit. If learning from success is dubious, learning from failures is substantially more dubious.

The only thing you can control is from which category of luck the failure was born. This failure was born from `Luck from Awareness`. Had I decided to work on some derivative game with no unique ideas, that would have pushed the failure into the `Blind Luck` category. I can assure you that failure in blind luck stings more, since it removes all agency.

An often overlooked detail is that these categories are too clean and can be mixed. Take for example the famed game developer Jonathan Blow, who has created several successful puzzle games. He is often reduced to a caricature, where the story goes something like "Once upon a time he made a game called Braid that blew up and he got rich, which funded his other projects". On the outside, it looks like `Blind Luck`. In reality, he faced rejections from contractors over his simple art style. The Steam store turned him down. Only through relentless hustling was he able to make it onto the Xbox indie game store, and even this had substantial pushback. Jonathan Blow knew that the mechanics and puzzle quality would matter substantially more than the art style, and this bet paid off. His success was a healthy blend of all of the types of luck.

The "blend" of luck you are exposed to is decided by the type of risk you choose to take.
| **Type of Risk** | **Primary Type of Luck** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Market Risk | Luck from Uniqueness | Will people even want this? Will my style resonate? |
| Execution Risk | Luck from Motion | Can we even put together the right team and deliver? |
| Technological Risk | Luck from Awareness | Will the technology advance enough to enable this? |

Whichever risk you subject yourself to will become your greatest hurdle. For this reason, it makes sense to choose a risk that aligns with your greatest strengths.

My educational game failed because of market risk. Nobody wanted what I was selling. Going forward, I am choosing to personally take on more execution and technological risk. As a deeply technological person, I have more knowledge to evaluate these risks.

For that reason, I am taking my unique experiences having worked at companies like Roblox and Manticore Games into my next ideas. I have seen how large monolithic game engines operate. I have spent months debugging esoteric memory leaks. I have seen how incredibly slow the development cycles can be. I no longer believe these engines are the long-term future.

I am directing my 'awareness' to work on miniature, specialized game engines, using emerging technologies like Rust/WGPU/WASM to eliminate the aformentioned pains. The incumbent giants have too much inertia to pivot to these technologies. In fact, the opposite has happened. Unity has deprecated their web player, abandoning web altogether. Being able to share a link and hop into a game with near-zero latency could be a huge distribution unlock. If Among Us had been shareable by direct link, its virality curve might have been quite literally vertical.

Of course, it may be that I am entirely wrong. Perhaps I am skating to where I believe the puck will be, and the puck will never get there. Or perhaps it will be intercepted by someone with even more foresight. But surely this is better than standing on the ice and waiting for the puck to come to me. And if I am mistaken, I can always just keep trying.

Instead of asking yourself, "what makes games successful?", perhaps the better question is, "what will make YOUR game successful?". What do you know about the world that others do not? In the end, the rule you follow may not save you, but it can tell you who you are. Like Chigurh's coin, circumstances will always spin beyond your control. The difference is whether you chose the coin, or let someone else hand it to you. As the chess saying goes, "A bad plan is better than no plan". To have no plan is to leave it all to a coin toss.
