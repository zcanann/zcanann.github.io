# Defeating Exponential Blowup - A Novel Approach to Pointer Scanning
An important problem that has, until now, remained unsolved by memory scanner developers is implementing an efficient pointer scanning algorithm. The premise is simple: we want to find pointer chains from **static memory** to a piece of useful information in **heap memory**.

The existing solutions all fall into the same trap of framing this problem as a graph problem, resulting in exponential blowup when attempting to apply BFS or DFS to pointer discovery. As a result, these algorithms rely heavily on heuristics to cut down the search space, without solving the underlying formulation of the problem.

This paper proposes a **range-based reachability method** that avoids the blowup by working in **hop-space**. The algorithm runs in linear time as a function of depth, is memory-efficient, trivially parallelizable, SIMD-friendly, and simple to implement. The key insight: although exponential expansion is inherent to enumerating paths, we can **factor it out and defer it** to user time (on-demand expansion) instead of algorithm time. This solution is extremely memory efficient, multi-thread compatible, SIMD friendly, and simple to implement.

# Problem Definition
To formally state the problem, given an address $T$, find all pointer paths from static memory $S$, that optionally traverse through heaps $H$, ultimately pointing to $T$. Each hop is constrained by a maximum offset $O$.

Note that static can be defined somewhat arbitrarily. This could include loaded modules, or even early entries in the threadstack for relevant threads. This is an implementation detail that can be altered independently of this algorithm.

To give an example problem, $T$ may be player health located at: `[[[game.exe+0x201c]+0x18]+0x24]`
Semantically, this may mean: `World (static +0x201c) -> Player (+0x18) -> Health (+0x24)`
In a high level language:
```
// Static global world instance.
static World;

struct World {
    ...
    Player* player;
}

struct Player {
    ...
    int health;
}
```

**Technical Requirements & Constraints**
- Support large processes (e.g., 16 GB+ RAM).
- Support large depths (e.g., 15+ pointer hops).
- Support for **Validation**. This is not formally defined, other than providing a method of reducing search space and invalid results. Generally, this means relaunching the program, finding $T$ again, and then validating whatever collected data structures are still able to reach $T$, pruning those that cannot. Some weaker forms of validation exist without relaunching.
- When validating results, missing results are unacceptable. However, validation may use **admissible heuristics**; it is acceptable to retain an invalid result, but unacceptable to discard a valid result.

**Resiliency Goal:** While extremely challenging, it would be ideal to support a path such as:
`World* -> Map<ENTITY_ID, Entity*> -> Player* -> Inventory* -> Map<ITEMID, ItemStack*> -> ItemStack* -> ItemCount`. Structures like a map can swizzle offsets, meaning these paths are intrinsically instable. However, these paths are technically valid when the entity is generally present, and overlooked by existing pointer scanners.

**Helpful Observations**
- Scoring and ranking are unimportant for our use cases. Displaying results sorted by static module origin (e.g., `game.exe` vs `phys_x.dll`) and hop distance are sufficient.
- Most process memory is zero. Anecdotally, there are many games where 75% of the process memory bytes are `00`.
- Many pointers are illusory (floats/garbage). Massive path collection up front is futile since validation prunes heavily.
- Pointers are often sparse but aggregated in structures.
- Pointers refer to addresses *near* a thing (e.g., $\(\text{player} + 0x28\)$), which is atypical for classical graph problems, and contributes to the intractability of naive BFS and DFS.
- Displaying *unvalidated* results is rarely helpful; initial sets are huge and noisy.

**Validation workflow (common practice):** relaunch the program, rediscover $T$, and check which collected structures still reach $T$; prune the rest.

 But it would be actually useful if we could find and keep these paths in some way, because they are technically valid, especially if the entity is generally within the map, like a Player*.

# The Algorithm

## Pointer Collection
For a moment, let us forget about the constraint of hopping through H. This means we simply want to find all pointer paths in S -> T. First, we take a snapshot of all static and heap memory, S and H. This is required for all pointer scanning algorithms.

It turns out that this can be expressed as a simple range check problem. We expand T backwards by O, giving us (T-O, T). In fact, T exists within H, so we will call this expanded range { H_0 }. Then we check every single address in S to determine if it falls within H_0. This will give us a list of all static pointers that fall within O of T. We will call this set S_0.

This entirely solves the problem for the case where we skip hopping through H, but it turns out that we can generalize the solution with a few additions. If we do the same operation on the heap, we can collect all addresses in the heap that fall within O of T. In other words, we collect all addresses in H that fall within H_0, yeilding H_1.

This is where the pattern starts to generalize. If we want to find static addresses that hop through the heap 1 time to reach T, we simply iterate over S, and check the value at each address to see if it falls within O of every address in H_1 via a binary search over the sorted heap ranges. This can be done by first expanding all addresses collected in H_1 by O. Care must be taken in the implementation to merge any regions that overlap from this operation. Everything that matches can be inserted into S_1.

At this point, the entire algorithm is completely generalized to any depth. At each level, we produce S_l and H_l by finding all pointers that fall within the previous H_l-1. The first case of course is the case where H_0 = {(T-O, T)}.

With this new binary search part, we now have developed a level based range reachability algorithm. In fact, we can augment this further to expand by O in both directions, creating (T-O, T+O), and doing similar for heap expansions. This gives us some resiliancy to map-like structures, which can shuffle offsets.

It is important to note that we are not concerned with collecting exact offsets -- the key insight of this algorithm is operating in hops as the fundamental unit. This is how we avoid exponential blowup. At no point do we evaluate any individual path, instead we only check for reachability. We are answering the question "can we hop to T through S and H at each level by a maximum hop size of O".

Once our algorithm is done, we have a set of {S_0, ... S_n}, {H_0, ... H_n}. These are very lightweight data structures that only contain ranges.

## Pointer Validation
Most of our results will be spurious, due to false pointers from garbage data or floats that were wrongly interpreted as pointers. To validate this, the recommended method is to relaunch the target program, rediscover T manually through memory scanning or other means. At this point, we can consider every previously collected H_l to be useless.

So, we discard these entirely, and rebuild them using the new (T-O, T+O) as our H_0. We do not rebuild S_l levels, as these are considered to still be valid. Once we rebuild each H_l using the exact method as before, we can validate each level of S_l by checking each static address at each level to see if it still contains a pointer that falls within H_l. Note that we only check if it falls within the exact level, ie S_0 checks to see if the pointer falls within H_0, and S_1 only checks if the pointers fall within H_1. Again, this is validated with a binary search, and if the pointer does not fall within range, it is discarded.

The key efficiency here is that we are still avoiding exponential blowup. We are making weaker guarantees in hop-space rather than pointer-space. If S_l can still reach H_l, then it is guaranteed to be able to eventually reach T.

## Deferred Exponentiation
Finding these exact paths is expensive, and requires walking backwards form T, but the nice part is that we can defer this expensive operation. We actually never need to construct the exact paths until the user requests them. One possible UX for this flow would be to have a GUI with a tree based expansion. The roots would be each static module, ie 'game.exe' or 'phys_x.dll'. Then these can be expanded further to see all top level heap hops. These can be expanded recursively until they hit T. Generally, the user will greedily expand the shortest hops in the most relevant looking static module.

This would be prohibitively expensive if we wanted to walk the entire tree, but the key insight is that for most use cases, manual walking is ideal. If the goal is to automate with tooling, or be exhaustive, then the exponential problem returns. That said, this algorithm is still more efficient than existing algorithms in that case, as by the time we pay the exponentiation price, we will have already reduced the search space by running validation. Existing algorithms need to pay the exponentiation price in validation.

## Notes on Implementation
- **Data structures:** store merged ranges per level for $\(H_\ell\)$ and optional compact lists for $\(S_\ell\)$. Keep them sorted for binary search.
- **Parallelism:** scanning memory for candidate pointers is embarrassingly parallel; split by region and merge ranges at the end.
- **SIMD:** bulk compare words against range bounds; bitmask results feed into the binary search stage to minimize branches.
- **Heaps vs statics:** collect module boundaries for $S$ (PE/ELF segments). For $H$, use the OSâs VMA enumeration, excluding guard/PROT_NONE.
- **Offsets:** the hop bound $\(O\)$ is a knob; larger $\(O\)$ increases recall (and noise). Symmetric $\((\pm O)\)$ improves robustness to container layouts.
- **Admissible validation heuristics:** only prune when certain an entry is invalid; never prune a potentially valid one.

---

## Summary
By reframing pointer scanning as **level-wise range reachability**, we:
- Avoid exponential path enumeration during collection and validation.
- Leverage cheap binary searches over merged ranges.
- Gain robustness to real-world layouts (maps, swizzled offsets).
- Keep exponentiation **deferred** and **user-driven**.

In short: think in **hops and ranges**, not explicit pointer paths, until you truly need them. And when they are needed, only display the bare minimum to avoid paying the full exponentiation cost.

## The Algorithm

### Pointer Collection (Range-Based Reachability)
For intuition, we will first ignore heap hops. We want all static pointers from $S$ that land within offset $O$ of $T$. This simplification turns the problem into a very basic binary range search problem.

1. **Snapshot memory.** Take a snapshot of $S$ (static) and $H$ (heap).

2. **Level 0 range:** expand $T$ by $O$ to form  
   $$
   H_0 \equiv (T - O,\; T + O).
   $$
   The key observation is that $T$ exists within $H$, hence naming this $H_0$. Note that negative offsets for pointers are not typical (positive expansion), but supporting this makes us robust to swizzled data structures, which we will cover momentarily.

3. **Static hits at level 0.**  We iterate all static addresses, and collect those that contain a pointer falling within $\(H_0\)$.
   $$
   S_0 = \{ s \in S \mid *s \in H_0 \}.
   $$

At this point, we have all static pointers directly to $T$, but it turns out that with a few additions, we can generalize this algorithm.

4. **Heap hits at level 1.** We perform the same exact operation that we just performed on $S$.
   $$
   H_1 = \{ h \in H \mid *h \in H_0 \}.
   $$

5. **Generalize to deeper levels:**  
   $$
   S_1 = \{ s \in S \mid *s \in \bigcup_{h \in H_1} (h - O,\; h + O) \}.
   $$

6. **Iterate:** for level $\ell \ge 1$, construct heap reachability
   $$
   H_{\ell} = \{ h \in H \mid *h \in \bigcup_{x \in H_{\ell-1}} (x - O,\; x + O) \},
   $$
   And construct static reachability
   $$
   S_{\ell} = \{ s \in S \mid *s \in \bigcup_{x \in H_{\ell}} (x - O,\; x + O) \}.
   $$

7. **Symmetric expansion:** use  
   $$
   (T - O,\; T + O)
   $$
   and similarly for heap expansions.

At completion:
$$
\{S_0,\ldots,S_n\},\quad \{H_0,\ldots,H_n\}
$$
as merged ranges or address lists.

This preserves the **no-exponential** property: we still reason in hop-space. If $\(S_\ell\)$ reaches $\(H_\ell'\)$, it can eventually reach $\(T'\)$.

### Deferred Exponentiation (On-Demand Path Materialization)
Enumerating **exact** paths is expensive (and again exponential in the worst case). We **defer** it until the user asks:

- Present a GUI with a tree view:
  - Roots = static modules (e.g., `game.exe`, `phys_x.dll`).
  - Children = top-level heap hops, and so on.
  - Users expand along plausible short-hop branches and stop when they hit $T$.

This is efficient because users rarely need the entire tree; they follow a handful of promising branches. If you *do* need exhaustive automation, the exponent shows upâbut **after** validation has already shrunk the search space, which is still better than traditional approaches that pay this cost *before* validation.
